# Dungeons and Repossessions

You are a medieval/fantasy repo man. You descend into dungeons to seize
loan collaterals and bring them back safely to creditors. Don't expect a
warm welcome.

Work-in-progress (by which I mean incomplete, not so much progressing)
roguelike, vaguely based on 5e DnD.

## Installation
* Clone the repo, enter the repo's directory
* `raco pkg install`

## Playing
* `racket -l dungeons-and-repossessions`

## Help (may be out of sync with the implementation!):
* arrow keys: movement
* `o`: open
* `c`: close
* `p`: pick-up
* `i`: inventory
* `s`: suicide
* `q`: quit
* space: wait

## Notes

For people stalking my "projects" (hi mom!), this is less featureful
than my previous roguelike (no online help, items, etc. etc.) but what
features are there should be more fleshed out. In both cases, though,
the goal was to have something for me to write, rather than fun for
anyone to play. :)
